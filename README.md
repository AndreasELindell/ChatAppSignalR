# ChatAppSignalR

This is the backend to a simple SignalR app for making groups and chatting with them.
Can use local DB och in memory DB for storing users using only Username, User SingalRconnetionid and chatroom.

Just run it in with Dotnet Run.

I wanted to learn more about Websockets and SignalR. That is why this app exist, hopefully other people trying to learn this can look at this repo and learn something!
